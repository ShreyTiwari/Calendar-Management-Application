If you are a windows user or just prefer to have all the code in one file, follow the steps below....

  1. Create a new file
  2. Add the contents of:
      a) cal.h
      b) cal_client.c
      c) cal_impl.c
    to the newly created file in the order specified above.
   
That's it! You are ready to execute the file on any 'C' platform or 'C' complier of your choice.
